### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a junior frontend developer and I'm currently working on personal projects. I am learning React and Node. I live in Colombia. I have a bachelor's degree in Business Administration and a technical degree in computer science.

I am currently focused on JavaScript, TypeScript, React and Node technologies. I am interested in building and designing APIs, solving architecture problems and functional programming.

I like to spend a lot of time sharing with my family, watching action movies, science fiction and documentaries. Occasionally I enjoy cooking.
